The 'examples/' folder is only intended to hold demonstrations of how to use riversound functions to work on data. As new functions are added and old ones improved, these examples may be changed to reflect new best practices.

Please do not edit these files yourself unless you're making a change that you want to share with everyone. You may easily lose your work if you work here.

'figure_code/' is a good place to keep your own scripts used to generate specific figures. I don't expect to modify files in figure_code/ created by others, except when collaborating with them.
